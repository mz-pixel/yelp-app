## Note
The app might not work as Heroku recently removed their free service, I have however connected my student github to heroku to access their paid features but am still waiting for approval.
## About
This app uses the python libraries of flask, request and JSON to get data from Yelp.com using api calls and formats them in an appealing manner using HTML.
